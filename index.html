Each persona represents a proportion of the real users. 
Each persona becomes the main character in their <a href="https://github.com/proversity-org/project-farfalla/blob/master/story-writing.md#user-stories" target="_blank">user story</a>. The main character has attitudes, motivations, pain points, and goals. 
Since we can measure whether a goal has been met or not, we can keep the project focused around the users in an exercise of goal-directed design.</p><p>Actual and Potential:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actual means that the user is currently on the system and is using it right now. Their main interests in relation to the bundl platform will be how it solves their ongoing problems with learning online. </li>
<li>Potential means that the user is not using bundl right now and needs convincing to do so. </li>
</ul>
<p>Web Comforts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Digital Native, High, Medium, Low</li>
</ul>
<p>Attitudes to Technology:</p>
<ul>
<li>Innovators are <strong>ventursome</strong> and enjoy being the first. They are quick to adopt <em>anything</em> new.</li>
<li>Early Adopters are <strong>opinion leaders</strong>. They see discoveries by innovators, find practical applications, and then communicate their opinions to their followers.</li>
<li>Early Majority are <strong>value shoppers</strong>. They wait until they are <em>sure</em> they are going to get value from the new product. </li>
<li>Late Majority <strong>wait for the majority</strong> to adopt innovation before subscribing to it as well.</li>
<li>Laggards are <strong>traditionalists</strong>. They adopt innovation unenthusiastically and generally say they are happy with what they have already.
Each class of adopter has a different burden of proof. This proof must be presented in an appropriate way.</li>
</ul>
